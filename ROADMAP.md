Below, you can see the key milestones we anticipate.
All the dates and the scope are aspirational.

> so there may be significant changes to the deliverables and the timeline.

## Project Board

We have a [project board](https://github.com/orgs/gradle/projects/96) published on GitHub Projects.
It captures the main initiatives and epics in this project.

## Key Milestones

### First Alpha Release

Scope: Declarative Gradle is available for evaluation with limited functionality and support from the team.
This includes:
the alpha release of the Declarative Gradle plugins,
basic integrations, demos, and documentation.
In this release, our primary focus is Android development,
but we keep in mind classic Java and Kotlin use cases,
as well as Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP).

- [Planned Issues (milestone)](https://github.com/gradle/declarative-gradle/milestone/1)
- [Prototypes](./unified-prototype/README.md)

### Public Early Access Release (EAP)

The first version is ready for broad external evaluation and feedback.
That includes making the Declarative Gradle plugins functional for core use cases, while this work is likely to continue after the milestone, and
having Early-Access IDE Support in Android Studio.

- [Planned Issues (milestone)](https://github.com/gradle/declarative-gradle/milestone/2)

### Public Alpha

Should the experiments and the EAP release be successful,
we intend to address the feedback over the summer and to release
a public Beta version in Autumn 2024.

### Public Release

To be scheduled depending on adoption and evaluation feedback.
