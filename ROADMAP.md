# Declarative Gradle Roadmap

Declarative Gradle is an experimental project under active development.
Below you can see the key milestones we anticipate.
All the dates and the scope are aspirational.

To  discuss the roadmap and the related initiatives, use the
`#declarative-gradle` channel on the [Gradle Community Slack](https://gradle.org/slack-invite)

## Project Board

We have a [project board](https://github.com/orgs/gradle/projects/96) published on GitHub Project.
It captures the key EPICs in this project.

## Key Milestones

### First Alpha Release

First release bits that can be evaluated with limited functionality,
and with support by the team.
This include the alpha release of the Declarative Gradle plugins,
and also basic integrations, demos and documentation.
In this release our main focus is Android development,
but we keep in mind classic Java and Kotlin use-cases,
and also Kotlin Multi-Platform.

- [Prototypes](./unified-prototype/README.md)

### Public Early Access Release (EAP)

The first version is ready for wide external evaluation and feedback.
That inclides making the Declarative Gradle plugins functional for core use-cases,
and also having Early-Access IDE Support in Android Studio.

### Public Beta

Should the experiments and the EAP release be succesful,
we intend to address the feedback over the summer and to release
a public Beta version in Autumn 2024.

### Public Release

To be scheduled, depending on adoption and evaluation feedback.
