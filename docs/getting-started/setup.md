# Setup

Declarative Gradle [samples](./samples.md) require nightly versions of Gradle and Android Studio.
They all use the [Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) to point to the right Gradle version, so you don't have to worry about installing a specific version of Gradle.

To try out the samples and see all of the features, you need to install a few other components as described below:

- [JDK](#jdk)
- [Android Studio](#android-studio)
- [Install the Gradle Client](#install-the-gradle-client)
- [Pick a sample](#pick-a-sample)

## JDK

Make sure to use a JDK >= 17 and that your `JAVA_HOME` points to it.

You can use a JDK from any vendor.
We recommend [Eclipse Temurinâ„¢ (OpenJDK)](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/).

## Android Studio

Download and install the Android Studio Nightly 2024.1.3.3 released on 2024-07-26.

* [macOS](https://redirector.gvt1.com/edgedl/android/studio/install/2024.1.3.3/android-studio-nightly-2024-07-26-mac_arm.dmg)
* [macOS Intel](https://redirector.gvt1.com/edgedl/android/studio/install/2024.1.3.3/android-studio-nightly-2024-07-26-mac.dmg)
* [Windows](https://redirector.gvt1.com/edgedl/android/studio/ide-zips/2024.1.3.3/android-studio-nightly-2024-07-26-windows.zip)
* [Linux](https://redirector.gvt1.com/edgedl/android/studio/ide-zips/2024.1.3.3/android-studio-nightly-2024-07-26-linux.tar.gz)

Declarative features are only available on particular nightly releases.

### Enable more declarative features in Studio

!!! info
    While syntax highlighting of `.gradle.dcl` files works out of the box in Studio nightlies, other features require flags to be enabled.

1. Open _Help -> Open Custom Vm Options_
2. Add text `-Didea.is.internal=true`
3. Restart the IDE
4. Open _Tools -> Internal Actions -> Android -> Edit Studio Flags_ and type _"Gradle Declarative"_ in the search window
5. Switch on the _Studio support for declarative files_ flags.

## Install the Gradle Client

The _Gradle Client_ is a standalone application used to demonstrate declarative features not yet implemented in the IDE.

Download the latest release from the [Gradle Client](https://github.com/gradle/gradle-client/releases/latest) repository on GitHub and install it.

The `DMG` file is for macOS, the `DEB` file is for Linux and the `MSI` file is for Windows.

## Pick a sample

After you've installed everything, pick out a [samples](./samples.md) to try the Declarative Gradle features.
