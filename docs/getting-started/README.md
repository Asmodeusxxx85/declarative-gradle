# Getting Started with Declarative Gradle

In our first [announcement](https://blog.gradle.org/declarative-gradle), we introduced our ideas for an experimental project we called Declarative Gradle. 

Since then, we've been working hard on several fronts to create the first early access preview (EAP) for Declarative Gradle.
In July 2024, we [announced the Early Access Preview (EAP)](./../EAP.md) of Declarative Gradle.
As part of this preview, we published several project samples that are ready for feedback.
These include Java, Kotlin, and Android application samples and a port of the popular Now in Android application.

    With the first EAP, we would like you to try out what we have built so far.

    Declarative Gradle is **ready** for trying out our provided sample projects for Java, Kotlin and Android applications.

    Declarative Gradle is **not ready** for adoption by plugin authors, build engineers or software engineers.

1. Follow our [setup instructions](./setup.md)
2. Pick one or more of our [samples](./samples.md)
