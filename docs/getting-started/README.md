# Getting Started with Declarative Gradle

In our first [announcement](https://blog.gradle.org/declarative-gradle), we talked about a new experimental project we called Declarative Gradle. That post introduced our ideas for a developer-first software definition and how we planned to create an elegant and declarative build language for Gradle. Since then, we've been working hard on several fronts to create the first early access preview (EAP) for Declarative Gradle.

!!! info
    With this first EAP we would like you to try out what we have built so far and to give us [feedback](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

    Declarative Gradle is **ready** for trying out sample repositories for Java, Kotlin and Android applications.

    Declarative Gradle is **not ready** for adoption in production by plugin authors, build engineers nor software engineers.
