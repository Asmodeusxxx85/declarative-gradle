!!! tip
    Make sure you followed the [setup](./setup.md) instructions fully before trying out a sample.

## Java Application

A sample Java application written in the Declarative Gradle DSL, using the prototype Declarative Gradle `javaApplication` Software Type defined in the `org.gradle.experimental.jvm-ecosystem` ecosystem plugin.

## Now In Android

Now in Android is a fully functional Android app built entirely with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. It follows Android design and development best practices and is intended to be a useful reference for developers. As a running app, it's intended to help developers keep up-to-date with the world of Android development by providing regular news updates.
